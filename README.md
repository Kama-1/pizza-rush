# This was a project started in grade 11
This was a project started in grade 11. It was a 1 month assignment which was initally not expected to be continued, however, I continued to work on in my free time for the following year.

## To future employers
I have drastically improved since grade 11 in all aspects of coding.
I highlight this project on my resume because I believe it showcases my passion for programming and my thirst for knowledge. 
<br><br>
When I started this project, I had extremely minimal experience with Java and programming in general. Despite that, with no mentorship other than online forums, I managed to create a playable mobile game.
<br><br>
Of course, I have now learned proper program structure, and am applying it to all my current and future coding endeavors.
